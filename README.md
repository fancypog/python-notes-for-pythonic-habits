# Python Coding Conventions and Best Practices

Notes for Python coding conventions to enhance readability, maintainability, and overall code quality. Examples are in note.py.

## 1. Naming Conventions

### Snake Case
Python recommends using snake case, where lowercase words are connected by underscores. This convention is typically used for naming functions.

### PascalCase
For class names

## 2. Type Annotations and Function Documentation

Declare the expected types of input and output. Additionally, use docstrings to provide clear documentation for functions.

## 3. F-strings for Concatenation

Use f-strings for string interpolation to make string formatting clearer and more concise. Do not use '+'.

## 4. Comparison Operators

Understand the difference between "==" and "is" operators. "==" is for value comparison, while "is" is for identity comparison.
