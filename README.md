# Python Coding Conventions and Best Practices

The script outlines some Python coding conventions to enhance readability, maintainability, and overall code qualityand. Examples are in note.py.

## 1. General naming convention: nake Case

Python recommends using snake case, where lowercase words are connected by underscores. This convention is typically used for naming functions.

## 2. Type Annotations and Function Documentation

Declare the expected types of input and output. Additionally, use docstrings to provide clear documentation for functions.

## 3. F-strings for concatenation

Use f-strings for string interpolation to make string formatting clearer and more concise. Do not use '+'.

## 4. Comparison Operators

Understand the difference between "==" and "is" operators. "==" is for value comparison, while "is" is for identity comparison.

## 5. Other naming conventions

Class. Class names should follow the PascalCase convention.
